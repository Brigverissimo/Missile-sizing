# Missile-sizing
EES code for missile size definition
The code contains correlations possessing R^2 greater than 90 %. The main outputs are missile preliminary length, weight, volume, and density. The code also calculates the same parameters for propulsion, warhead, and guidance and control (GC) subsystems.
Nomenclature:
AR - aspect ratio,
b - booster,
Crr - chord (width) of the wing at the root,
Ctr - chord of the wing at the tip.
DEN - density,
DIA - diameter,
LEN - length,
PP - propulsion,
r - ramjet,
RNG - range,
Se - exposed planform area (wing or tail)
SWP - leading edge sweep angle,
TR - taper ratio,
VOL - volume,
WH - warhead,
WT - weight.
